The Butterfly Effect:
It's fascinating to think about how small, seemingly insignificant events or decisions can have far-reaching consequences. The concept of the butterfly effect suggests that the flap of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world could set off a chain of events leading to significant changes elsewhere. It's a reminder of the interconnectedness and complexity of systems.
